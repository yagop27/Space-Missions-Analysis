<h1>Space Missions Data Analysis ðŸš€</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project analyzes space mission data to uncover trends and insights related to global space exploration efforts. The analysis includes launch frequencies, organization-wise performance, and temporal trends. Visualizations are created using Python libraries such as plotly, matplotlib, and seaborn to make the insights engaging and informative.

<h2>Features</h2>

  - Data Cleaning and Preparation:
    - Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
    - Leveraging ISO 3166 for standardized country data.
  - Launch Analysis:
    - Frequency of space missions over the years.
    - Organization-wise analysis of launch activity.
  - Interactive and Static Visualizations:
    - plotly for interactive plots.
    - matplotlib and seaborn for detailed static visualizations.
  - Annotations: Highlights specific findings, such as the organization with the most launches in a given decade.
